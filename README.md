# Description

Welcome to my personal git repository for deep learning training. Here, I am experimenting with different neural network architectures and deep learning algorithms to understand how they work.

## Program 1: Neuron Recognition Algorithm (neuron.py)

### Objective

The objective of this program is to implement a recognition algorithm for distinguishing between dogs and cats using a single neuron.

### Conclusion

After training the algorithm, we observed that the accuracy of the train set was not bad. However, we also encountered the problem of overfitting. To overcome this, we need to increase the number of examples in our dataset significantly. Additionally, since a single neuron is linearly separable, we cannot solve this problem using a single neuron. Hence, we need to start building a network.

Let's move on to building a neural network to solve this problem!
